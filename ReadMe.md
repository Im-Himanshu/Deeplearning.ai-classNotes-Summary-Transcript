## Content creation Collabration Guide

You can also contribute in organizing the content for this repo and help others in their learnign journey. I have devise a way on how the different slides should be organized and how the snapshot shoot to be taken

1. The Maximum text to be shown per slide is limited to 15-16 line and image is limited to 200 height which fits in 12 line + 4-7 line extra at max.
2. We will take another screenshot whenever this much content is covered
